Dasher is brought to you by the Inference Group, led by David MacKay, who is a Professor in the Department of Physics and cofounder of the information technology company, Transversal. David MacKay created the first Dasher prototype in 1997.

* David Ward developed the research version of Dasher from 1998 to 2002; for his PhD, David turned Dasher into a working software system, created numerous enhancements to it, and conducted experiments to quantify how well it works. David now works for Spiral Software, Cambridge.
* Alan Blackwell, a lecturer in the Computer Laboratory, helped us design the experiments.
* Phil Cowans and Tim Hospedales have also made contributions, especially to the eyetracking work.
* During Summer 2002, the Open Source software package was prepared for release by Iain Murray. Iain started a PhD in computational neuroscience at UCL in October 2002.
* Phil created Dasher version 3 for GNU/linux. Hanna Wallach worked on version 3 for the ipaq running linux.
* In December 2002, the Dasher project received funding from the Gatsby foundation to support Matthew Garrett as project manager and developer. The project is also being joined by experts from the free software community, to contribute further enhancements and carry out the ports to a wider variety of computer platforms.
* During 2003-2005, Chris Ball took over as project manager and developer.
* Keith Vertanen develops Speech-Dasher (2003-2007).
* During Summer 2005 several programmers joined the Dasher project. Tadashi Kaburagi contributed the Asian language model for Dasher version 4. Brian Williams added game-mode for version 4. Chris Hack added automatic speed control for version 4. Ingrid Jendrzejewski did experiments on Button Dasher. Frederik Eaton fixed a cursor-display problem.
* From October 2005, Piotr Zielinski joined the Dasher team as developer of Ollie Williams's gaze-tracking, head-tracking, and gesture tracking software, and developer of two-dimensional Dasher.
* From January 2006, Phil Cowans is Dasher project manager and developer.
