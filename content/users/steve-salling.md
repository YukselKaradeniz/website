## Steve Saling 

I am a big fan of technology and I use Dasher for hours every day. I began preparing for life as a quadriplegic immediately after my diagnosis. I was horrified by the long term care options that were available and was fortunate to meet the CEO of a nursing home organization who wanted to create a radically new model of care. Watch this video to learn a little of my story https://youtu.be/mgYeTy8qNyY.

I have gotten a lot of media attention in the past 8 years and much of it includes at least a snippet of Dasher because the interface is so bad ass. I don't know what warrants a case study but Dasher is an integral part of my life and I will offer to help any way I can. Thank you for your work and I look forward to getting to know you.
